          <h1>What is Origami?</h1>
          <p>
            Origami is the ancient Japanese art of paper folding. It involves
            creating intricate and often delicate sculptures using just a single
            sheet of paper, meticulously folded into various shapes and designs
            without the use of scissors or adhesive. The art of origami
            showcases the beauty of simplicity and precision, with a focus on
            transforming a flat piece of paper into three-dimensional works of
            art.

          <h1>Quick Origami History</h1>
          <p>
            So who invented origami? It is impossible to tell. What history can
            tell us, is that the strongest and longest origins of origami are
            found in Japan. In Japan, historians have found evidence of origami
            dating back to 1680, through the writings of Ihara Saikaku. Ihara
            Saikaku detailed the role of origami in Japanese culture in his
            stories and poems, as origami found its way into the traditions of
            weddings, gift-giving and other practices. There are also many
            traditional Japanese stories that feature origami, such as Abe no
            Seimei. Just over one hundred years later, in 1797, Akisato Rito
            published the first origami book, Hiden Senbazuru Orikata, The
            Secret to Folding Cranes.
